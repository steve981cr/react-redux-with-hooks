https://www.techandstartup.com/tutorials/react-redux-with-hooks-basics

This project was set up with create-react-app.

It uses an API of mock data as it's source.

There are four versions of this app that all make the same API call and render the same result. The difference is in how state is stored and accessed. These include:
React without Hooks.
React with Hooks.
React and Redux without Hooks.
React and Redux with Hooks. 
The App.js file uses the React and Redux with Hooks version.

To run the application use:

npm start 

Or if you have Yarn installed use:

yarn start

The app will launch on port 3000.
